Every year the demand for swiftlet&#8217;s nests that can be consumed is increasing rapidly. Usually, swiftlet&#8217;s nests are used as raw materials for traditional medicines, food ingredients, and cosmetic raw materials that use ingredients from nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swiftlet building is a special building designed to accommodate swallow colonies which are usually used as a source of raw material for swiftlet nests which have high economic value. A well-designed swiftlet house can provide a comfortable and conducive environment for swiftlets so that they can breed and produce high-quality nests. With a variety of sizes, the design of the swiftlet building is owned by PT Lentera Alam Nusantara, which of course is in accordance with the wishes and size of the land it owns. . The size of 14\u00d714 square meters of the swiftlet building is one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"770\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-770\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/8-3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"769\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-769\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/7-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One type of swiftlet house that is ideal for swiftlet breeders to choose is a swiftlet house with a size of 14\u00d714 size. This building is the largest size design offered by PT Lentera Alam Nusantara. The 14\u00d714 swiftlet building has a large enough size and can accommodate a large number of swiftlet colonies. Usually, this swiftlet building has a height of about 6 meters with a number of floors that can reach 4 floors. The design of this swiftlet building is quite simple with a flat roof and walls covered with cement. To ensure that the environmental conditions inside the swiftlet building remain comfortable for the swiftlets, it is necessary to make some adjustments to temperature, humidity and lighting. For example, the ideal room temperature for a swiftlet colony ranges from 28-32 degrees Celsius with humidity around 70-80%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"766\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-766\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"768\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-768\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/6-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiftlet bird houses that are very large in size can be easily installed in the available area. In addition, this swiftlet building is also very easy to design and build, so it will save costs and time for swiftlet breeders. Another advantage of the 14&#215;14 square meter swiftlet building is the ability to accommodate more swiftlets at one time. With a very large capacity, this swiftlet house can accommodate a large number of swiftlet capacities, thereby increasing the productivity and profitability of the swiftlet farming business. By using a swiftlet building measuring 14\u00d714 square meters, swiftlet breeders can also more easily manage and monitor swiftlet bird activity in the house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-5 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"767\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-767\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/5-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"763\"  src=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-763\" srcset=\"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipped with facilities that make it possible to maintain ideal environmental conditions for swiftlets, a 14\u00d714 size swiftlet building can also be chosen as another option. Heating and air conditioning systems, lighting systems, as well as good ventilation systems are facilities that can be installed. The environmental conditions inside the swiftlet house can be kept stable and comfortable for swiftlets to breed and produce quality bird nests with this facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several key factors to consider when designing a swiftlet house, including the location, orientation, size, and shape of the house. In order for the birds to find it easily and disturbance from outside factors such as noise and pollution is minimal, it is important to place the swiftlet house in the right location in the area. The orientation of the swiftlet house must be such that it receives optimal sunlight and is protected from wind and rain. To maximize the use of the available space and allow proper air circulation, the house must be designed in such a way with the right size and shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In building a swiftlet building measuring 14\u00d714 square meters, you can involve experts who are experienced in this field. That way, every detail and aspect related to the condition of the swiftlet and its building can be carefully considered, so that the swiftlet building can function optimally as a place for swiftlets to live and as a source of raw materials for quality swiftlet nests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? A swiftlet building measuring 14\u00d714 square meters can be a valuable asset for starting a swiftlet cultivation business and producing high quality swiftlet nests. Immediately build your own swiftlet building and start a profitable swiftlet farming business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>READ MORE : <a href=\"\/design\/convenient-and-condusive-swiftlet-building-design-4x4\">CONVENIENT AND CONDUSIVE SWIFTLET BUILDING DESIGN 4&#215;4 SIZE<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>READ MORE : <a href=\"\/design\/convenient-and-condusive-swiftlet-building-design-12x12\">CONVENIENT AND CONDUSIVE SWIFTLET BUILDING DESIGN 12&#215;12 SIZE<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":765,"template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"disabled","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/design\/777"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/design"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/design"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/765"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/eng-ternak-walet.test\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=777"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
